										To tell the truth, I wanted to be a math teacher. I was a really bad student of English. My English was the worst when I was a student, and at that time I liked studying math. I had a lot of good teachers. 
My favorite subjects at school were mathematics and PE. I liked to sing in the music classes, too. I wanted to be a teacher, and I wanted to study and teach math. But I failed the entrance exam for the university, and I had only one choice to become a teacher. That was to be an English teacher. This is my 16th year as an English teacher.
About 15 years ago, in 2009, I traveled to Canada to study English. Before traveling to Canada, I taught English a little bit to junior high school students. I felt like my English skill was better than theirs, but I was so bad, so I needed to study English more and more. I decided to go to Canada. I spent about one year there and I met a lot of friends from other countries. So that became the best memory in my life. 
I think that English is a communication tool. So we need to communicate with many people, people from other countries using English. We can use it to see many kinds of foreign cultural things, such as dramas, movies, and songs.
It’s important to study English because studying or learning English gives us a wider world. We can see new things. If we study English, we can see more of the world.

										Cordelia: But did you study English in University?
										<br /><br />
										Mr. Sugawara: Yes, I did. But, actually, of course I took

										study so hard.
										<br /><br />
										Both: *laugh*
										<br /><br />
										Cordelia: I see.
										<br /><br />
										Mr. Sugawara: But when I was a third-grade student in
										university, I joined a kind of international volunteer work.
										And I have been to some countries and I talked with local
										young people in English. So, yes, that kind of experience is
										a kind of studying.

									<p style="font-size: 3.5vh; text-align: left">
										Cordelia: Ok, why do you think English is important or
										useful for us?
										<br /><br />
										Mr. Sugawara: Maybe I have two opinions. The first one is
										that speaking English is kind of a communication tool. So as
										I said, if we can speak English, we can go anywhere. And we
										can talk to a lot of people, and I can touch many cultures
										or something. But, as you know, in Japan maybe we don’t have
										to speak English to live. But if we can learn another
										language, we can learn another culture. And we can get new
										viewpoints to see the world. So I think this is just my
										opinion, but all Japanese should study English.
										<br /><br />
										Cordelia: I see.

										Mr. Sugawara: So first of all, please enjoy studying,
